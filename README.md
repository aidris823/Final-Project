ChessGUI by Steven Chen & Anand Idris, Period 9:

Welcome to our Final-Project, whose goal is/was to be a functional chess game.

In order to start this program:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Checkout the "Master" branch.
3. "javac *.java"
4. java RunChess

Enjoy =)

The pawn's movement is a bit off because of the fact that pawn's can only capture diagonally.
Couldn't figure out how to check if there is a piece diagonally across from it or not. 
The turn is a bit wonky. It will tell you if it's black or white's turn, but it will occasionally switch.
